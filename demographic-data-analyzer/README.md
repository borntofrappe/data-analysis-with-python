## Assignment

_Please note:_ to test the code locally I copied the first and last 200 observations from the actual dataset in `data.csv`. In the REPL the code is applied to the larger file.

You are given a dataset of demographic data that was extracted from the 1994 Census database, considering such properties as age, work class, education, occupation and relationship.

Use Pandas to answer the following questions:

- How many people of each race are represented in this dataset? This should be a Pandas series with race names as the index labels. (`race` column)

- What is the average age of men?

- What is the percentage of people who have a Bachelor's degree?

- What percentage of people with advanced education (`Bachelors`, `Masters`, or `Doctorate`) make more than 50K?

- What percentage of people without advanced education make more than 50K?

- What is the minimum number of hours a person works per week?

- What percentage of the people who work the minimum number of hours per week have a salary of more than 50K?

- What country has the highest percentage of people that earn >50K and what is that percentage?

- Identify the most popular occupation for those who earn >50K in India.

Update the code so all variables set to "None" are set to the appropriate calculation or code. Round all decimals to the nearest tenth.
